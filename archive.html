                <article class="entry"><h1>Making this 'blog'</h1>
            
                    <p>During the attempted production of this creation,
                        I discovered that CSS manipulation is quite 'fiddly', lots of googling solves most problems of course and alas - there is color and some managed styling now - optimized I hope for phone-sized browsing.
                        <br><br>
                        Adding unaccounted elements is troublesome and requires special coding. I wish I choose a more 'general' approach to handling content for grids.
                        I'll keep fiddling with this during the course as i pick new tricks up to try and get it 'proper' I suppose.
                        <br><br>
                        I spent alot of time experimenting with strange behaviours that I thought could be 'cool' but ended up - in my opinion - tasteless and a waste of time.
                        <br><br>
                        I imagine working with someone elses pre-made stylesheets saves alot of time in this regard - instead of writing everything up from scratch, though I embrace this opportunity to learn something new and figure I can only get better the more I practice.
